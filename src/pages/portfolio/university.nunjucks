        <h1>University</h1>
        <p>
          I spent six years at university, both as an
          undergraduate, and a postgraduate. Here is some
          of the stuff I got up to.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>C classes</dt>
          <dd>
I got to earn a little money whilst I was doing Ph.D. research (in Medical
Electronics) supervising C classes for the second year electronics
undergraduates. They were using new editor tools on a new operating system
(the *new* Windows NT had just been deployed across the site), and that had
caused many teething troubles. So I produced some
<a href="chelppages/index.html">help pages</a> to assist the students.
It is provided here more as a curiosity, although if you are trying to
use a windows c compiler with PFE it might be helpful to you. :-)
          </dd>
          <dt>Star Trek Society</dt>
          <dd>
Throughout my time at University I was on the Committee of the Star Trek
Society (Founding Committee Member in fact). I was Secretary, and when some
group of physicists invented the World Wide Web (apparently), I also took
on the responsibility of Webmaster for the society home pages. Alas the
website is no more as the web server in question was taken down a number of
years ago. However you can still view the old pages via the trusty
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980516030907/alethea.ukc.ac.uk/SU/Societies/StarTrek/">Way Back Machine</a>.
<br><br>
Possibly the best part of the site was
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990204024946/alethea.ukc.ac.uk/SU/Societies/StarTrek/Conventions/">The UK Convention Diary</a>
that I administered. It would seem that it had become the definitive resource
if you wanted to go to a Star Trek or Sci-Fi Convention in the UK, and
apparently still is, which is unfortunate as the server no longer exists.
However I have plans to build a new one, and its going to be bigger and
better. So watch this space. And if you come across anyone else trying to
link to the old location on alethea.ukc.ac.uk then tell them to watch this
space as well.
