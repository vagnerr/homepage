   <H1>C/NT Problems - Running</h1>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="NoSub">"Substitution cannot be performed..."</a></h2>
    <P>
      PFE produces the error <EM>"Substitution cannot be performed in the
      specified command line as either no file is currently open, or
      the current window does not contain a named file"</EM>
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be caused by the same two problems as those that cause
      the same error during <a href="Compile.html#NoSub">Compiling</a>
    </p>
      <DL>
      <DT><STRONG>You have the wrong window in focus.</strong>
      <DD>
	(eg. you have a compiler output window selected).  You need to
	select the window with the c-code in it. This is most likely
	as you will probably have just tried to compile your code.

      <DT><STRONG>Your c-code has no filename.</strong>
      <DD>
	(ie. you have not saved it yet) You should save your c-code
	first. This will give it a filename to substitute for the %f
	and %n in the command line. <STRONG>The filename must end in
	.C</strong> This is less likely as you would not have been
	able to compile your code.
    </dl>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="NotCompiled">"...The system cannot find the file specified."</a></h2>

    <P>
      You try running your program (with the <STRONG>Run</STRONG> button,
      <!--Image Here?-->) and you get
      <EM>
	"Unable to create process: [2] The system cannot find the file
	specified."
      </EM>
    </P>
    <P>
      You must successfully compile your code before you can run it
      otherwise you will have no executable to run.
    </P>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="NotDotC1">"...%1 is not a valid Windows NT application"</a></h2>
    <P>
      You try running your program (with the <STRONG>Run</STRONG>
      button, <!--Image Here?-->) and you get
      <EM>
	"Unable to create process: [193] %1 is not a valid Windows
         NT application.
      </EM>
    </P>
    <P>
      You have probably changed the <STRONG>Command to run</STRONG>
      from <CODE>%n.exe</CODE> to something like
      <CODE>assess1.c</CODE>
      This will not work as you do not actually run the assess1.c gcc
      compiles it into an executable called assess1.exe and you need
      to run that. Either by putting back <CODE>%n.exe</CODE> or
      by running <CODE>assess1.exe</CODE> or even just
      <CODE>assess1</CODE>
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="NotDotC2">"This file does not have a program associated with it..."</a></h2>
    <P>
      You try running your program from the DOS prompt by typing
      something like <CODE>assess1.c</CODE> and you get the error
      <EM>
	"This file does not have a program associated with it for
	performing this action. Create an association in My Computer
	by clicking View and then clicking Options."
      </EM>
    </P>
    <P>
      you do not actually run the assess1.c gcc
      compiles it into an executable called assess1.exe and you need
      to run that. So just type <CODE>assess1</CODE>
    </P>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="DosClose">DOS Window Closes Suddenly</a></h2>
    <P>
      On running your program the DOS window closes before you get a
      chance to read the output.
    </P>
    <P>
      The DOS window attached to the run command for PFE is configured
      to close when your program exits, and your program will exit
      when it gets to the end of the main function. The best way to
      get round this is to start up a separate DOS window (with the
      DOS <!--Image --> icon on PFE) and run your code manually, by
      making sure you are on the Z drive (if you are not type
      <CODE>z:</CODE> and press &lt;RETURN&gt;) and if your code were
      called assess1.c then you would run it by typing
      <CODE>assess1</CODE>
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="Scanf">You type some input but nothing happens</a></h2>
    <P>
      After running your code and it asks you for some input (if you
      put something like <CODE>printf("Enter Values\n");</CODE> in
      your code) you type some input and your program does not seem to
      respond.
    </P>
    <P>
      It is quite possible that this is due to problems with scanf. If
      you put any trailing spaces in the format string of scanf, for
      example:- <BR>
      <PRE>
   scanf("%d %d %d ",&f[0],&f[1],&f[2]);
                  ^</PRE>
      The the program will be waiting for that space before the scanf
      function returns. To fix this simply remove the trailing space.
    </P>
