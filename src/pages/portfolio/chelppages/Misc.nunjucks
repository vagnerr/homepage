    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="MountW">Drive W: Not Mounted</a></h2>

    <P>
      Occasionally NT will simply Decide to unmount your W: Drive
    </p>
    <P>
      To Fix this you will have
      to "Map the network drive." To do this start up <STRONG>Windows
      NT Explorer</strong><BR>

      <IMG SRC="NTExpl1.gif" WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="332" ALT="(Select: Start, Programs, Windows NT Explorer)">
    </p>
    <P>
      Then from the menu select <STRONG>Tools, Map Network Drive...</strong>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="NTExpl2.gif" WIDTH="304" HEIGHT="167" ALT="">
    </p>
    <P>
      Then Select <STRONG>W:</strong> from the <STRONG>Drive:</strong>
      Combo box. It should read
      <STRONG><CODE>W:   \\eentserv\Apps</code></strong>
      if it doesn't then you need to fill in the
      <STRONG>Path:</strong> below with
      <STRONG><CODE>\\eentserv\Apps</code></strong>
      and click on <STRONG>OK</strong>
    </p>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="Quota">Over Quota</a></h2>

    <P>
      You can check to see if you are over quota by selecting your
      directory from <STRONG>ELG on Bodiam</STRONG> and clicking on it
      with the right mouse button and selecting
      <STRONG>Properties</STRONG>. Then look for the property
      <STRONG>Size</STRONG> in the window. This will eventually show
      the total amount of disk space you are using. if it goes over
      5Meg then you are over quota and will not be able to write to
      your own directory.
    </P>
    <P>
      To get back under quota you must remove some of the unwanted
      files. You can either delete them (select them and hit the
      delete key) or move them to your directory of eentserv. To move
      them you must open up your directory on eentserv and select the
      files/folders/directories you want to move and drag them to your
      eentserv folder <STRONG>With the RIGHT Mouse Button</STRONG> You
      will then be asked if you want to copy, move or make a
      shortcut. Select <STRONG>Move</STRONG> and it will proceed to
      move all the files across.
    </P>
    <H3>NOTE:</h3>
    <P>
      Going over quota is very likely to cause your
      <A href="#Security">Security settings to be corrupted</a> so it
      is best to fix them as well.
    </P>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="Security">Corrupt Security Settings</a></h2>

    <P>
      To check to see if you security settings have been corrupted
      select your home folder from Bodiam with the right mouse button
      and select <STRONG>properties</STRONG> then select the
      <STRONG>Security</STRONG> tag and click on the <STRONG>Security
      Settings</STRONG> button. If your security settings have been
      corrupted then a message box will appear to tell you and when
      you hit OK you will find it blank. Other wise you will just see
      the security settings all filled in with your login, Bodiam
      Administrators, etc.
    </P>
    <P>
      If your security settings have been corrupted then you will need
      to add yourself back on to access your own files. To do this:-
    </P>
    <OL>
      <LI>
  Select the check-boxes for <STRONG>Files in this
  directory</STRONG> and <STRONG>Subdirectories</STRONG>.
      <LI>
  Click on the <STRONG>Add</STRONG> button.
      <LI>
  Select <STRONG>Find User</STRONG> and enter your login, then
  click on <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.
      <LI>
  Select your login and select <STRONG>Full Access</STRONG> from
        the access options, and click on <STRONG>Add</STRONG>
      <LI>
  Your login should then appear on the security settings window
  with <STRONG>&lt;Full&gt;&lt;Full&gt;</STRONG> next to it.
      <LI>
  Click on <STRONG>OK</STRONG>. NT should then go through all
        your files resetting permissions.
    </OL>
    <H3>NOTE:</H3>
    <P>
      You must select <STRONG>Full Access</STRONG> for yourself. The
      default is read only and if you let NT set the permissions to
      Read Only you will not be able to change them and will have to
      get the System administrator to fix it.
