      If you want to e-mail your assessment from UNIX then you will
      need to upload it from your NT account (if you have not also
      been working on your assessment on UNIX). To do this, log into
      your UNIX account then type <STRONG>ftp bodiam</STRONG> for
      username give <STRONG>UKC\&lt;your_login&gt;</STRONG>, and for
      password give your NT password. You will then need to change
      into the right directory eg
      <STRONG>cd ELT/&lt;your_login&gt;</STRONG> then type
      <STRONG>get &lt;filename&gt;</STRONG> where &lt;filename&gt; is
      the name of your c assessment. You can then type
      <STRONG>quit</STRONG>. You will now have you work on UNIX where
      you can use your favorite e-mail program and insert the file or
      you can mail the assessment with the command :-<BR>
      <STRONG>
  mail pjw -s "C Assessment - Week 10" &lt; &lt;filename&gt;
