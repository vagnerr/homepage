   <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="NoInst">No Install Packages Icon</a></h2>
    <P>
      If you have no Install Packages icon on your desktop then your
      profile is probably corrupt and you will have to go and see
      <A HREF="mailto:helpdesk">computing help-desk</a>.
    </p>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="NoPFE">Cannot Find PFE in the Install Packages List</a></h2>
    <P>
      PFE is installed from the "
      <STRONG>
  Install Electronics Packages
      </strong>,"
      icon not from the "Install Packages" icon. Try there.
    </p>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="NoElecPack">No Electronics Packages Icon</a></h2>
    <P>
      You have to install the "Electronics Packages" Icon
      yourself. Double Click on the Install Packages Icon and select
      "<STRONG>Install Electronics Packages</strong>" from the list
      and click on the Install button. If it says you have already
      installed this and do you want to install it again click on
      "Yes." Once you have done this the "Electronics Packages" Icon
      should appear somewhere below the "Install Packages" on the desktop.
    </p>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="ElecPackErr">Clicking on Electronics Packages Causes an Error</a></h2>
    <P>
      When you double-click on the Electronics Packages icon it
      produces the error
      <img src="WinInst1.gif" WIDTH="340" HEIGHT="119" alt="The application list (W:\wininstall.lst). is missing!">
      or something similar, rather than running.
    </p>
    <P>
      There are two possibilities for this. First is that the
      "Shortcut" entry has been set incorrectly. This can be checked by
      clicking and holding down the <STRONG>right</strong> mouse
      button over the electronics packages icon and selecting
      <STRONG>properties</strong>.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="EPackPr1.gif" WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="240" ALT=""><BR>
      Then from the options at the top
      select <STRONG>shortcut</strong>. The Target should read
      "<CODE>W:\WinInstall\Winstall.exe W:\wininstall\winapps.lst</code>"<BR>
      <IMG SRC="EPackPr2.gif" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="237" ALT=""><BR>
      If it doesn't then change it so that it does.
    </p>
    <P>
      The second possibility is that your profile does not have the
      Electronics Apps drive mounted on W: in which case see
      <A HREF="Misc.html#MountW">Drive W: Not Mounted</a>.
    </p>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="FileNotFound">"File not Found!"</a></h2>
    <P>
      At about 70% installed the install package program produces the
      error "Error n: File Not Found"
    </p>
    <P>
      What has actually happened is Install Packages has not been able
      to write the PFE config file to your home folder. The most
      likely cause of this is that you are
      <A HREF="Misc.html#Quota">
  over quota
      </a>
      or your
      <A HREF="Misc.html#Security">
  security settings have been corrupted.
      </a>
    </p>

    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="CannotFind">Cannot Find PFE</a></h2>
    <P>
      After logging out and back in again you cannot find PFE.
    </p>
    <P>
      First check to see if it is on the start menu under:-
    </p>

    <DL>
      <DT><STRONG>Start</strong>
      <DD>
  <DL>
    <DT><STRONG>Programs</strong>
    <DD>
      <DL>
        <DT><STRONG>Electronics</strong>
        <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><STRONG>PFE</strong>
      <DD>
        <STRONG>PFE32</strong>
      </dd>
    </dl>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <P>
      If it is not there then try re-installing PFE again. If it is
      vanishing after logging out and back in again then your NT
      profile maybe getting corrupted/reset and you will have to speak
      to <A HREF="mailto:helpdesk">computing help-desk</a>
    </p>
