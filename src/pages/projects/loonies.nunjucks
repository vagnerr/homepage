        <p>
          A long standing commitment has been the general
          maintenance of this mail archive. In its current basic
          form it is just an indexed store of the nearly ten
          years of jokes. However I have been experimenting
          (with a friend) with possible improvements to the site
          for things such storage of the mails, and indexes in
          a database, and have the entire site run dynamically
          with either Perl or PHP. This would allow better
          maintenance and search indexing, along with reduced
          content size.

          If you want to see the site then you can access
          it by going to:-<br>
