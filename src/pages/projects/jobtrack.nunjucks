        <h1>Job Applications Tracker</h1>
        <p>
          I had been keeping track of job applications with aid
          of an excel spread sheet, but that wasn't good enough,
          so I wrote a fully functional job tracking system with
          PHP and MySQL. It has full cross-referencing of Agencies
          and Agents with Jobs and notes. Plus the storage of the
          job adverts and source where appropriate. It is
          currently functional and in final test. You can find
          more details of the project on
          <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jobtrack/">
            SourceForge</a>.
          It will have its first release shortly but until then
          all the code is available in the
          <a href="https://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jobtrack">
            CVS Repository</a>.
