        <p>
          I have dabbled in JavaScript over the years, be it as
          a challenge, or to fulfil a need. Included here are
          some of the results. (more to come).

              One major app which I was involved in was the writing of
              a password protection
              system that you can implement on free webspace. It is
              called JPS.
