        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>
          Most of my Java work in the past has been games based (check out the
          <a href="/games/">Games Page</a> for more details). However I have
          been reading up on J2EE recently. In addition to that a friend and
          I spent a couple of weeks writing Java AI code for
            Java Robots or "RoboCode."
          It was more of a challenge in trigonometry and
          simultaneous equations math than in Java, but it was a fun
          diversion and well worth a look if you want to kill some time.
          I have included the source of one of my robots
          <a href="Wander2.java">here</a> if you are interested. Its really
          quite dumb, but it does try and calculate "leading shots." Of
          course all the target has to do is change direction or speed
          and you will miss but its a start. At some time I will add
          an explanation of the trig needed for the leading shots should
          anyone want to take that and improve on it. :-)
