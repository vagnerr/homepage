        <h1>Perl</h1>
        <p>
          I have been using Perl now for over 10 years, since a University
          friend gave me a quick intro into how useful it can be.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="/projects/makelive.html">Makelive</a></dt>
          <dd>
          I am working on a website release system based loosely
          on a system that we used to use on the first student run
          web server at my University. More details on my progress
          can be found <a href="/projects/makelive.html">here</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="/projects/parse-webcounter.html">
            Parse::WebCounter
            </a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            A simple perlmodule that can read back the value
            of a standard graphical webcounter. More detail
            can be found <a href="/projects/parse-webcounter.html">here</a>.


          </dd>
          <dt>Seti</dt>
          <dd>
          I have a number of machines in my home network and the
          spare CPU cycles are currently dedicated to the
          <a href="http://www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">
            Seti Project
          </a>.
          Obviously being involved in that is all about the stats
          so I have written a number of simple Perl scripts to
          extract current user and group stats from the XML feeds
          that the seti server supplies. There are pages on the
          seti server to display the data already, but I wanted
          to play and not have to browse the site to get the
          stats all the time. I have three scripts at the moment.

          <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt><a href="getstat.pl">getstat.pl</a></dt>
            <dd>
            Grabs the data for a particular user (by email
            address) and prints it to the screen.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="getstats.pl">getstats.pl</a></dt>
            <dd>
            Grabs the stats for a particular group (by name)
            and lists all the users in order of most
            reported blocks.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="storestats.pl">storestats.pl</a></dt>
            <dd>
            Similar to getstats.pl, however instead of
            printing out the results it stores the data in
            a database. You can then run it daily as a cron
            job and collect a nice amount of data for
            generating graphs of your progress against the
            progress of fellow team mates (will be working
            on these analysis scripts next).
            </dd>

          </dl>
